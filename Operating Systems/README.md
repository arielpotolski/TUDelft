# Assignment Information
- It is important to notice that we were provided with a raspberry pi containing some libraries, which I was required to use during the implementation of the assignments. Therefore, although the IDE might point out a few bugs, the code worked properly during the course labs, since I ran it in the raspberry pi, using putty.
