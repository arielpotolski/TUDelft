/*
Now that youâ€™ve familiarized yourself with the structure of the database and made it thread safe,
let us consider some usecases of the database.

Quite often, a database is read much more often than it is written to. In fact, the test suite performs 8x
as many reads as writes (and calls both the consumer and producer functions in parallel).

In such a case, a so-called Read-Write lock may prove more performant. Repeat the previous assignment,
but use read-write locks instead of mutexes for thread safety.
